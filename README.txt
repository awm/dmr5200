DMR-5200 Interface Library

This is a simple library to read and format data from the serial interface on a
Circuit-Test DMR-5200 digital multimeter. The connection settings and data
format for the meter are described in Section 8 of the DMR-5200 manual.

The included "dmr5200" script illustrates how to use the library, and can be
used as a simple tool to generate CSV formatted readings from a connected
multimeter.

The library assumes that the multimeter has already been put into RS-232 mode
using the procedure described in Section 8 of the manual.
